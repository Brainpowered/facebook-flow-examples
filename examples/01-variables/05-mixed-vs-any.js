// #FlowExpectError â€“ even though 112 is a number, it is typed as `mixed`
var y: number = getSomething();

// Of course, you can manually refine a mixed type:
var z: number = (typeof x === 'number' ? x : 0);

// can flow into it, but unlike `mixed`, `any` can also flow into any other type.

// `any` is a hack, something you can use to get Flow out of your way, e.g.
// when dealing with third party libraries. Don't abuse it.

// If you do use `any`, make sure to have some other means to check validity of your code.
